# tidyselect

## Overview

The tidyselect package is the backend of functions like `dplyr::select()`
or `dplyr::pull()` as well as several tidyr verbs. It allows you to
create selecting verbs that are consistent with other tidyverse packages.


## Installation

tidyselect is on CRAN. You can also install the development version
from github with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyselect")
```
